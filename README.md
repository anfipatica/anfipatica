âš¡ When I was a kid I wanted to be a hacker, but I also happened to love art so I **obviously** took the safest path and studied art restoration.

Strangelly, that's where I discovered my love for âš¡ programming âš¡ and now I can't imagine my life in any other way.

So... <u>here I am</u> ðŸ‘€. I don't work as an art restorer and I'm not a hacker *(yet)* but I feel like I get the best of both worlds thanks to programming, since I see it as another form of art. Art is frustrating yet beautiful and rewarding. That's how I feel about code and the reason I rather be known as Anfi, since what I upload here I see it as new art creations in a new medium.

âœ¨ But yeah if you know me from 42 Hey! I'm Yolanda! Follow me to see how this strange adventure goes on!
