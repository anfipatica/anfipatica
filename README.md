ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Yolanda (or Anfi as my *artistic* name) and I'm a programming student in 42 Madrid.

When I was a kid I wanted to be a hacker, but I also happened to love art so I *obviously* took the safest path and studied art restoration.

Strangelly, that's where I discovered my love for programming and now I can't imagine my life any other way.

So... here I am  ðŸ‘€. I don't work as an art restorer and I'm not a hacker *(yet)* but I feel like I get the best of both worlds thanks to programming, since I see it as another form of art. Art is frustrating yet beautiful and rewarding. That's how I feel about code and the reason I rather be known as Anfi, since what I upload here is nothing more than new art creations in a new medium.

 âœ¨ Follow me to see how this strange adventure goes on!
